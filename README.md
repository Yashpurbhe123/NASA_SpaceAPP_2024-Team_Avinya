# Seismic Detection Across the Solar System

## Project Overview

In planetary exploration, seismology plays a critical role in understanding the internal structure and activity of celestial bodies like the Moon and Mars. By detecting seismic events—such as marsquakes or moonquakes—scientists can gain valuable insights into a planet’s internal composition, tectonic movements, and geological history.

A significant challenge arises from the large volume of data generated by seismometers. Most of this data consists of background noise from lander operations, environmental factors, and mechanical disturbances. Only a small fraction is scientifically relevant—specifically during seismic events.

Due to limited power and bandwidth on space missions, transmitting all the data to Earth is impractical. Our solution proposes a system that operates directly on the lander to:
- Analyze seismic data in real-time and detect genuine seismic events.
- Filter out noise and discard irrelevant data.
- Transmit only essential seismic signals back to Earth, conserving power and bandwidth.

This system enhances mission efficiency and extends its lifespan by focusing on transmitting only the most valuable scientific data.

## Dataset Overview

### Key Parameters in the Dataset

1. **time_abs (Absolute Time)**
   - Timestamps in ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmm`).
   - Example: `1971-01-03T00:00:00.197000`.
   - Used to accurately determine when each seismic measurement was recorded.

2. **time_rel (Relative Time in Seconds)**
   - Represents elapsed time since the start of data collection.
   - Example: `0.150943` seconds after the first reading.
   - Critical for tracking time intervals and calculating sampling rate.

3. **velocity (m/s for lunar, c/s for Mars)**
   - Seismic wave velocity, expressed in meters per second (m/s).
   - Example: `2.282837e-15 m/s`, indicating a subtle movement.
   - Helps differentiate significant seismic events from background noise.

### Purpose of the Dataset

The dataset records seismic wave velocity over time, which is essential for:
- **Seismic Event Detection**: Identifying quakes and other ground movements.
- **Noise Filtering**: Isolating meaningful seismic signals from high-frequency noise.
- **Quake Detection**: Detecting spikes or significant shifts in velocity.



## The Denoising Process

### Python Script Overview

This Python script implements a low-pass Butterworth filter to denoise the seismic velocity data. It separates the main seismic signal from noise and visualizes the result.

#### Main Code for Denoising
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from scipy.signal import butter, filtfilt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

# Step 1: Load your data
data = pd.read_csv('xa.s12.00.mhz.1972-02-21HR00_evid00190.csv')
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

# Step 2: Define a low-pass Butterworth filter
def butter_lowpass(cutoff, fs, order=5):
    nyquist = 0.5 * fs
    normal_cutoff = cutoff / nyquist
    b, a = butter(order, normal_cutoff, btype='low', analog=False)
    return b, a

def lowpass_filter(data, cutoff, fs, order=5):
    b, a = butter_lowpass(cutoff, fs, order=order)
    y = filtfilt(b, a, data)
    return y
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

# Step 3: Calculate the sampling frequency
time_diff = np.diff(data['time_rel(sec)'])
fs = 1 / np.mean(time_diff)
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

# Step 4: Apply the low-pass filter to the 'velocity(m/s)' column
cutoff_frequency = 0.1
filtered_velocity = lowpass_filter(data['velocity(m/s)'], cutoff=cutoff_frequency, fs=fs)
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

# Step 5: Calculate the noise by subtracting filtered data from original
noise = data['velocity(m/s)'] - filtered_velocity
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

# Step 6: Save the separated waves
main_data_wave = data.copy()
main_data_wave['velocity(m/s)'] = filtered_velocity
noise_wave = data.copy()
noise_wave['velocity(m/s)'] = noise

main_data_wave.to_csv('main_data_wave.csv', index=False)
noise_wave.to_csv('noise_wave.csv', index=False)
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

# Step 7: Plot the original signal, filtered signal, and noise
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 8))

plt.subplot(3, 1, 1)
plt.plot(data['time_rel(sec)'], data['velocity(m/s)'], label='Original Signal', color='blue')
plt.title('Original Velocity Signal')
plt.xlabel('Time (sec)')
plt.ylabel('Velocity (m/s)')
plt.legend()

plt.subplot(3, 1, 2)
plt.plot(main_data_wave['time_rel(sec)'], main_data_wave['velocity(m/s)'], label='Denoised Signal', color='green')
plt.title('Denoised Velocity Signal (Main Data)')
plt.xlabel('Time (sec)')
plt.ylabel('Velocity (m/s)')
plt.legend()

plt.subplot(3, 1, 3)
plt.plot(noise_wave['time_rel(sec)'], noise_wave['velocity(m/s)'], label='Noise', color='red')
plt.title('Extracted Noise')
plt.xlabel('Time (sec)')
plt.ylabel('Velocity (m/s)')
plt.legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
 
```

### How Denoising Works

The Butterworth filter applied in the code above separates the primary seismic wave signal from background noise. This process is vital for:
1. **Removing Unwanted Noise**: Filters out high-frequency noise from environmental interference.
2. **Improving Signal Interpretation**: Makes it easier to identify seismic trends and key patterns.
3. **Enhancing Data Quality**: Clean data enhances subsequent analysis and model accuracy.
4. **Improving Visualization**: Noise-free signals provide clearer and more interpretable visualizations.
5. **Maintaining Data Integrity**: Ensures the data reflects actual physical phenomena without external interference.
6. **Avoiding False Conclusions**: Prevents misleading results that could arise from noisy data.
7. **Better Feature Extraction**: Clean data leads to more accurate identification of features such as seismic peaks or frequency components.

## Why Denoising is Important

1. **Removing Unwanted Noise**: High-frequency noise can originate from various sources, including sensor inaccuracies or environmental interference.
2. **Improving Signal Interpretation**: Noise can obscure key trends and features, complicating the identification of patterns.
3. **Enhancing Data Quality**: Clean data significantly enhances machine learning models, statistical analysis, and signal interpretation.
4. **Improving Visualization**: Denoised signals are clearer and easier to analyze visually.
5. **Maintaining Data Integrity**: Ensures that the data represents the true dynamics of the system being studied.
6. **Avoiding False Conclusions**: Noise can lead to misleading conclusions, especially when looking for subtle seismic events.
7. **Better Feature Extraction**: Ensures that important features such as peaks or transitions are detected more accurately.

## Conclusion

By denoising the seismic data from lunar and Mars missions, we have improved its clarity and accuracy. This process is essential for accurately analyzing seismic activity, filtering out irrelevant data, and preserving the most valuable scientific information for transmission back to Earth. The result is a more efficient mission, with enhanced data quality and extended operational lifespan.

# Seismic Detection Across the Solar System

![Image](Screenshot%202024-10-06%20221618.png)

## Project Overview

In planetary exploration, seismology plays a critical role in understanding the internal structure and activity of celestial bodies like the Moon and Mars. By detecting seismic events—such as marsquakes or moonquakes—scientists can gain valuable insights into a planet’s internal composition, tectonic movements, and geological history.

A significant challenge arises from the large volume of data generated by seismometers. Most of this data consists of background noise from lander operations, environmental factors, and mechanical disturbances. Only a small fraction is scientifically relevant—specifically during seismic events.

Due to limited power and bandwidth on space missions, transmitting all the data to Earth is impractical. Our solution proposes a system that operates directly on the lander to:
- Analyze seismic data in real-time and detect genuine seismic events.
- Filter out noise and discard irrelevant data.
- Transmit only essential seismic signals back to Earth, conserving power and bandwidth.

This system enhances mission efficiency and extends its lifespan by focusing on transmitting only the most valuable scientific data.

## Dataset Overview

### Key Parameters in the Dataset

1. **time_abs (Absolute Time)**
   - Timestamps in ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmm`).
   - Example: `1971-01-03T00:00:00.197000`.
   - Used to accurately determine when each seismic measurement was recorded.

2. **time_rel (Relative Time in Seconds)**
   - Represents elapsed time since the start of data collection.
   - Example: `0.150943` seconds after the first reading.
   - Critical for tracking time intervals and calculating sampling rate.

3. **velocity (m/s for lunar, c/s for Mars)**
   - Seismic wave velocity, expressed in meters per second (m/s).
   - Example: `2.282837e-15 m/s`, indicating a subtle movement.
   - Helps differentiate significant seismic events from background noise.

### Purpose of the Dataset

The dataset records seismic wave velocity over time, which is essential for:
- **Seismic Event Detection**: Identifying quakes and other ground movements.
- **Noise Filtering**: Isolating meaningful seismic signals from high-frequency noise.
- **Quake Detection**: Detecting spikes or significant shifts in velocity.



## The Denoising Process

### How Denoising Works

The Butterworth filter applied in the code above separates the primary seismic wave signal from background noise. This process is vital for:
1. **Removing Unwanted Noise**: Filters out high-frequency noise from environmental interference.
2. **Improving Signal Interpretation**: Makes it easier to identify seismic trends and key patterns.
3. **Enhancing Data Quality**: Clean data enhances subsequent analysis and model accuracy.
4. **Improving Visualization**: Noise-free signals provide clearer and more interpretable visualizations.
5. **Maintaining Data Integrity**: Ensures the data reflects actual physical phenomena without external interference.
6. **Avoiding False Conclusions**: Prevents misleading results that could arise from noisy data.
7. **Better Feature Extraction**: Clean data leads to more accurate identification of features such as seismic peaks or frequency components.

## Examples of Denoised Data

### Example 1: Original and Filtered Data of lunar dataset > S12_GreadB > xa.s12.00.mhz.1972-02-21HR00_evid00190.csv

- **Original Dataset**: This is the raw dataset provided for analysis.

- **Note** - The seismic wave data provided by NASA, which contained noise, has been fully denoised using our Jupyter program. We have organized the data into separate folders for each wave. Within each folder, the denoised main data and the noise data for each wave are stored. The main data is saved as **main_data_wave.csv**, while the noise data is saved as **noise_wave.csv**. This structure is maintained for every wave, with each wave stored in its own folder.<br>
For faster access and demonstration purposes, we have included a single wave from both the Lunar and Mars datasets. These two waves are stored in the **Lunar Data Wave Denoising Prototype** folder and the **Mars Data Wave Denoising Prototype** folder, respectively. This serves to showcase how we developed the solution. The same denoising process has been applied to all the waves provided by NASA.

## Why Denoising is Important

1. **Removing Unwanted Noise**: High-frequency noise can originate from various sources, including sensor inaccuracies or environmental interference.
2. **Improving Signal Interpretation**: Noise can obscure key trends and features, complicating the identification of patterns.
3. **Enhancing Data Quality**: Clean data significantly enhances machine learning models, statistical analysis, and signal interpretation.
4. **Improving Visualization**: Denoised signals are clearer and easier to analyze visually.
5. **Maintaining Data Integrity**: Ensures that the data represents the true dynamics of the system being studied.
6. **Avoiding False Conclusions**: Noise can lead to misleading conclusions, especially when looking for subtle seismic events.
7. **Better Feature Extraction**: Ensures that important features such as peaks or transitions are detected more accurately.

## Conclusion

By denoising the seismic data from lunar and Mars missions, we have improved its clarity and accuracy. This process is essential for accurately analyzing seismic activity, filtering out irrelevant data, and preserving the most valuable scientific information for transmission back to Earth. The result is a more efficient mission, with enhanced data quality and extended operational lifespan.
